## this reads in an RDS file provided by the Imperial team  on April 11
ens_preds <- readRDS("./data-raw/Imperial/20200426-ensemble_model_predictions.rds")
forecast_date = as.Date("2020-04-26")

## the object is a big list, with one element for each of the 5 times forecasts were made
## each of those elements is itself a list, with one element for each country
## each of the country-specific items is a list with two ensemble forecasts, one for each serial interval assumption
## each forecast itself is a matrix with rows as samples (30K) and columns representing days in the future

## this code produces the mean predicted incident deaths for seven day-ahead
## colMeans(ens_preds$`2020-04-05`$United_States_of_America[[1]])


## transform and write the files for each date
