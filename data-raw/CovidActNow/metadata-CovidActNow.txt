methods: >-
    Forecast by model built by PhDs in epidemiology and physics, based on expert opinions in public health and
    epidemiology of infectious disease, and updated based on daily feed data in cases, deaths, and hostpitalizations.

methods_long: >-
    The SEIR Model makes forecast of cumulative deaths, incident deaths, incident hospitalizations by fitting predicted cases, deaths, and hospitalizations to
    the observations. Quantiles of the forecast are derived by combining model parameters' prior distribution and
    chi squares of fitting the SEIR models to the observations.
