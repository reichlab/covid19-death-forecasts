    Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 in the United States.

institution_affil: Iowa State University - Department of Statistics

data_inputs: >-
    New York Times -nytimes/covid-19-data, health department webpages, 
    County-level infected case and death data

methods_long: >-
    We develop a nonparametric space-time disease transmission model for the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19 at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to dissect the spatial structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast how this outbreak may unfold through time and space in the future. The projections assume that the data used is reliable, the future will continue to follow the current pattern, and current interventions will remain the same till the end of forecasting period.
