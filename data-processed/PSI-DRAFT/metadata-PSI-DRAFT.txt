    JHU cumulative deaths, 
    U.S. Census populations and age distributions

methods_long: >-
    Deterministic fit of a compartmental SEIRX model to cumulative death profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the optimal parameters. All compartments are stratified by age. 'I' compartments are additionally divided by disease severity into Asymptomatic, Mild, Flu-like, and Severe.  Severe disease is defined by the need for an ICU bed. Interventions are fit generically to a two value smooth function.  Forward projections are conditional on interventions/reproductive number remaining unchanged.
