team_model_designation: primary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: Neural network based on the N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2000) model for univariate time series, adapted to work on an encoding of multiple input variables. In addition, the N-BEATS architecture is extended to provide error variance forecasts.
