    April 22: Experts in the modeling of infectious disease, public health, and epidemiology provide forecasts of 
    the smallest, most likely, and largest possible cumulative number of deaths at the US level. We transform each 
    expert's three estimates into a triangular probability distribution and take an equally-weighted average of 
    expert predictive densities.
