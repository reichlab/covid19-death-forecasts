   We predict COVID-19 daily new cases using a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model. We account for transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period, use a time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention, and quantify uncertainty by permutation. We use a regression model to predict cumulative deaths from estimated time-lagged cumulative total number of COVID-19 cases.
