    This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease 
    dynamics. This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters 
    and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social 
    distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically 
    with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days 
    of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were 
    drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR 
    dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within 
    counties. 
    
    Stay-at-home orders were applied and lifted at the state level according to 
    recent policy documents. After stay-at-home orders end, social distancing 
    remains in effect through the end of the simulation with a roughly 25% 
    reduction in effectiveness relative to that from stay-at-home orders. States 
    that did not implement stay-at-home orders had a single social distancing 
    intervention that began on the day of the first reported order and endured 
    for the whole simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where 
    possible.
    
    To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated 
    realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to 
    ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform 
    a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we 
    assume a 0.25% infection fatality rate and a 7:1 ratio of incident 
    hospitalizations to deaths. 
    
    For each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline 
    reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the 
    effectiveness of stay-at-home and social distancing interventions. We use an 
    MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county 
    aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA 
    Facts. For the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case 
    confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing 
    of strength among counties in the same state.
    
    Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the 
    last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.
  
    The estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both 
    epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to 
    health outcomes) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies 
    on social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
