  County-level metapopulation model with commuting and stochastic SEIR disease dynamics. 
  This model makes predictions about the future based on the best available policy information 
  about current state-level restrictions and their publicly-stated (past or future) start and end 
  dates. Prediction intervals include uncertainty from two different R0 reduction levels 
  that reflect our uncertainty about the effectiveness of these state-level restrictions.

  This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease dynamics.  
  This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters and the effectiveness of 
  state-wide intervention policies on social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are 
  seeded stochastically with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days 
  of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were drawn stochastically 
  for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates 
  the spread of disease within counties. Social distancing and stay-at-home orders were applied and 
  lifted at the state level according to the most recent policy documents. To model deaths in the 
  population, we incorporated realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization 
  to ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to standardize the probability 
  of transition through these states by county. The quantiles reported by this model incorporate 
  uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health 
  outcomes, infection fatality ratio) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on 
  social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
