methods: >-
    The ensemble combines models unconditional on particular interventions 
    being in place with those conditional on existing social distancing measures 
    continuing. Models are combined by taking arithmetic averages of quantiles and 
    point estimates. 

methods_long: >-
    April 13: At state level, only two models included in first week, LANL and IHME,
    due to overlaps in location and reported quantiles. At national level, IHME
    was combined with the three CU models. 
    April 27: Different component models at state level and national level.
    Please see the model information file for more details.
