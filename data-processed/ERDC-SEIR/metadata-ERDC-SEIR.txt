    The ERDC SEIR model makes predictions about future infection states of a population (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infections reported to authorities, infections unreported),
    by using Bayesian curve-fitting methods to conform the model dynamically to past data.

methods_long: >-
    This model makes predictions about the future infection states of a population center (e.g., state, CBSA), which are based on several standard assumptions common to population modeling.
    Relative to COVID-19, it assumes that trends in the data persist into the future beyond the latest available datum.  Other assumptions include:
        (i)   modeled populations are large enough that fluctuations in the disease states grow slower than averages (i.e., coefficient of variation < 1);
        (ii)  infection parameters change over time in response to changing social and policy factors which manifest in the data (e.g., social distancing policies);
        (iii) recovered individuals are neither infectious nor become susceptible to further infection.
    
    A Bayesian approach is used to fit cumulative reported and new daily infection data to the infection states as predicted by the model.  Curve fitting is performed dynamically,
    which leads to infection parameters (e.g., transmissibility) that change over itme. As a result, the effective reproduction number, as estimated by the model for SARS-CoV-2 using the next-generation matrix method approach,
    changes with time, potentially up to the last reported dataum, after which the model parameters remain constant in reflection of our assumption regarding the contiuation of existing social policy.
    Deaths are estimated from this model through a procedure which leverages state-level data on recoveries and fatalities.
