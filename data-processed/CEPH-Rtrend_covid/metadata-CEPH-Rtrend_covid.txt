methods: 'Renewal equation based on Rt estimation from hospitalization data.'
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods_long: 'Model forecasts are obtained by using a renewal equation based on the estimated net reproduction number Rt. We used MCMC Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of Rt based on the data, considering an informed prior on Rt based on COVID-19 literature. Finally, Rt used in the renewal equation is based on a the posterior distribution and trend of the estimated Rt in the three most recent weeks of COVID-19 hospitalization data. '
