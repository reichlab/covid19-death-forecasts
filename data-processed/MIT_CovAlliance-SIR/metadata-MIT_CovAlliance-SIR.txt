    A SIR model trained at the public heath region level. SIR parameters are functions of over 60 static demographic features and time-varying dynamic features that measure changes in mobility patterns. This model proposes a two stage approach to overcome the inherent difficulty in learning the magnitude of the peak infection rate. The first stage treats the total susceptible population as an unknown parameter and learns this parameter for regions that have not yet seen a peak in cumulative infections. The second stage fits a typical SIR model with time and location varying contact parameters.
