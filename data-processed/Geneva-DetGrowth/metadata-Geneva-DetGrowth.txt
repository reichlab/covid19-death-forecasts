    We calculate the growth rate of cumulative cases (resp. deaths) between two days ago and today. 
    If greater than 5%, we use an exponential model to forecast. Otherwise, we use a linear model.

    "We calculate the growth rate of cumulative cases (resp. deaths) between two days ago and today. 
    If it's greater than 5%, we use an exponential model to forecast the cumulative number of cases (resp. deaths), 
    and then derive the daily number of cases (resp. deaths). If it's less than 5%, we use an linear model instead."
