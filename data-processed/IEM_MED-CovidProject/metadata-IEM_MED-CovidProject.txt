methods: County-level, state-level, and national-level SEIR model projections for daily incident confirmed COVID 
  cases by using AI to fit actual cases observed.
data_inputs: JHU reported daily confirmed cases
methods_long: "IEM is currently using an AI model to fit data from various sources \
  \ and project new cases of COVID-19. We do not assume the average number of secondary \
  \ infections (R-value) stays the same over time. Our model makes projections for \
  \ over 375 individual counties in the U.S., all 50 states, the District of Columbia, \
  \ and 3 U.S. territories. For each jurisdiction, our model runs 4 million simulations \
  \ to find the best R value that would allow the SEIR model to fit the data for confirmed \
  \ cases. Our model assumes that the R value changes quite rapidly over time due to changes \
  \ in human behavior. Our model uses a sliding window to fit the data and find the best \
  \ R values for each of the windows. Projections of future cases assume that human behavior \
  \ and social distancing measures are unchanged."
