    The ERDC SEIR model makes predictions of several variables (e.g., reported new/cumulative cases 
    per day, etc.). Model parameters are estimated using historical data using Bayesian inference.

    The ERDC SEIR model is a process-based model that mathematically describes the virus 
    dynamics in a population center (e.g., state, CBSA) using assumptions that are common 
    in compartmental models:
    (i)   modeled populations are large enough that fluctuations in the disease 
    states grow slower than averages (i.e., coefficient of variation < 1)
    (ii)  recovered individuals are neither infectious nor become susceptible to 
    further infection.

    The model is similar to classic SEIR models but with additional compartments for 
    unreported infections and isolated individuals.  Model parameters describing reporting 
    rates and transmission rates are allowed to vary in time over over the historical 
    record as social and policy factors change.  Forecasts into the future, however, 
    are made under the assumption that the parameters are held constant in time.

    The model parameters are estimated from observations of the cumulative number of 
    cases using a Bayesian approach. Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is 
    used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters.  This 
    then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior 
    probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative 
    observations and subject matter expertise.  The parameters that maximize the posterior 
    probability density are used to make forecasts into the future.  The effective reproduction 
    number is computed using the next-generation matrix method.

    Deaths are estimated from this model through a procedure which leverages state-level 
    data on recoveries and fatalities.
