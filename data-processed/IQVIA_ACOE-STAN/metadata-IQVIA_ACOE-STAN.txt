methods_long: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for state-level pandemic prediction.
  Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak
  predictions by (1) using patients EHR data from different states that encode local disease
  status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical
  proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models.
  STAN uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and
  predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical
  law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction.
