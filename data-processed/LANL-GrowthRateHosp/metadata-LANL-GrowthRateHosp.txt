	This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular intervention strategies. The model consists of three processes. The first process is a statistical model of how the number of COVID-19 infections changes over time. The second process maps the number of infections to the reported data. These first two processes constitute the LANL-GrowthRate model. The third process maps the number of new reported infections to new hospitalizations. (LANL-GrowthRate) We model the growth of new cases as the product of a dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases in the population at the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting susceptible population. The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the newly generated cases will die and learn that fraction from observations. We can also anticipate when the outbreak is likely to peak, i.e. when the daily number of new confirmed cases reaches its maximum." (LANL-GrowthRateHosp) Of the new cases, we draw the number of new hospitalizations from poisson distributions informed by state demographics and age-group symptomatic case hospitalization rates obtained from Planning Parameters for COVID-19 Outbreak Scenarios provided by the CDC.
