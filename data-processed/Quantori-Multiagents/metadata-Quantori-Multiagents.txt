The Agent-based local stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission
    

methods_long: >- 
This model incorporates the reported geographic incidence data, which include individual’s age, infection status, and the severity of the disease. 
The model accounts for the latent period of the individual’s infection before detection and proper reporting as well as for different disease severity levels. 
The framework also allows to incorporate the exact geographic addresses of individuals (if available) or the random geographic distribution of individuals.
