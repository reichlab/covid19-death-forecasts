    The SEIR Model makes forecast of cumulative deaths, incident deaths, incident hospitalizations by fitting predicted cases, deaths, and hospitalizations to
    the observations. Quantiles of the forecast are derived from forecast error (comparing latest observation and corresponding forecast) rescaled based on days forward of forecast.
