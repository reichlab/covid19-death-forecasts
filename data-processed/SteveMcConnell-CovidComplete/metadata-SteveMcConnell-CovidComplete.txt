methods_long: "This is a near-term fatality prediction model that calculates and\
  \ uses fatality trends at the national and state level, trends in positive virus\
  \ tests and total virus tests, and age-related demographics for state forecasts.\n\
  Model forecasts are based on predicting near-term deaths from recent positive virus\
  \ tests. The model assumes average delays of 4 days from infection to test, 14\
  \ days from positive test to death, and 18 days from infection to death.\
  \ No assumptions are made about the effectiveness of interventions or treatments;\
  \ the model assumes that any such change in effectiveness will be included implicitly\
  \ in the historical fatality data and the fatality rates calculated from that data.\
  \ No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental interventions."
