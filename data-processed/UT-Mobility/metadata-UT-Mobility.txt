methods: >-
    This model makes predictions assuming that social distancing patterns, as measured by anonymized mobile-phone 
    GPS traces, remain constant in the future.  However, we receive this data in real time to update forecasts on 
    a weekly basis.  This model models only *first-wave deaths*.

methods_long: >-
    For each US state, we use local data from mobile-phone GPS traces made available by [SafeGraph] to quantify the 
    changing impact of social-distancing measures on ``flattening the curve.''  SafeGraph is a data company that 
    aggregates anonymized location data from numerous applications in order to provide insights about physical places. 
    To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices visitedan 
    establishment in a month from a given census block group.  These data are aggregated by state to create metrics 
    of social distancing, which are used as predictors in the model.
    We use a Bayesian multilevel negative binomial regression model for the number of deaths for each day, and implement 
    the model in R using the rstanarm package.
