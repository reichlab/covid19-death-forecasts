methods: Agent-based simulation model to project COVID19 infection spread.
institution_affil: Georgia Institute of Technology
data_inputs: Georgia Department of Public Health
methods_long: "We developed an agent-based simulation model to predict the spread of COVID19 \
    \ geographically and over time. The model captures both the \
    \ natural history of the disease and interactions in households, workplaces, schools, and communities. \
    \ The model was populated with COVID19 parameters from the literature and population-related data \
    \ from the state of Georgia, including demographic information,\
    \ household sizes, and travel patterns, and validated using data regarding COVID19 confirmed cases \
    \ and deaths in Georgia. We have also extended our model to include results for North Carolina using \
    population-related data from the state of North Carolina."
