methods_long: "We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which\
  \ has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social-\
  \ distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \
  \ for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \
  \ different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \
  \ We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \
  \ exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \
  \ mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \
  \ mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \
  \ In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \
  \ of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \
  \ meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, \
  \ fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. \
  \ The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \
  \ retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \
  \ our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \
  \ analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \
  \ error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \
  \ based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been \
  \ included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later.\
  \ Since Sep 6, 2020, the infection rate and recovery rate were fitted up to Aug 9, 2020, \
  \ while assuming the infection rate drops 15% afterwards. This is motivated by the \
  \ consistent over-prediction from our model solely based on mobility. This is also reasonable\
  \ considering the mutation of the virus over more than half year. \
  \ Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update. "
