team_model_designation: primary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: The SuEIR model is a variant of the SEIR model considering both untested
  and unreported cases. The model considers reopening and assumes susceptible population
  will increase after the reopen.

methods_long: "We update our model by considering the effects of reopenings. In particular,\
  \ for the states that have reopened or partially reopened, we assume there is a\
  \ transition from a virtual  \u201CQuarantined/Isolated\u201D group to the \u201C\
  Susceptible\u201D group at a certain rate after the reopen date. This rate along\
  \ with other model parameters are jointly estimated based on the reported data.\
  \ The key feature of the SuEIR model is that it can infer the untested cases as\
  \ well as unreported cases. More specifically, we treat the \u201CExposed\u201D\
  \ group in the SEIR model as the individuals that have already been infected and\
  \ have not been tested, which are also capable of infecting the \u201CSusceptible\u201D\
  \ group. Moreover, some of the people in the \u201CExposed\u201D group can get tested\
  \ and transferred to the \u201CInfectious\u201D group (which are reported to the\
  \ public), while the rest of them will recover/die and transit to the so-called\
  \ \u201CUnreported Recovered\u201D group (which are not reported to the public).\
